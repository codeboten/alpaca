# alpaca
The aim of alpaca is to provide an easy user interface to support deploying functions on container supported infrastructure. Ideally users will never need to build a container to run their code using alpaca.

## Roadmap
- [ ] API to create functions
- [ ] Configurable backend storage for endpoint mapping
- [ ] gateway to map endpoints -> containers
- [ ] HTTPS support using letsencrypt
- [ ] runner for python
- [ ] runner for nodejs
- [ ] runner for golang
- [ ] runner for ruby
- [ ] support for scheduled events
- [ ] support other kinds of events? (ie. queues)
